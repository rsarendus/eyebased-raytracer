# Eye-based Raytracer

This is just a hobby project - a re-write of an even older hobby project that I was working on many years ago. The current primary purpose of this project is to practice writing clean and easy to understand (and hopefully performant) Java code, nothing more.

## Build

Building the project requires at least JDK11.

1. Fetch it from GitHub:<br>
`git clone https://github.com/rsarendus/eyebased-raytracer.git`

2. Navigate into the project's root directory:<br>
`cd eyebased-raytracer`

3. Build:<br>
`mvn clean install`
